# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Keycodes set in Vial must persist correctly across power cycles and map to the correct layers
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Reference Analysis

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Reference Analysis)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-13 -- Completed 01-01 data extraction (13 source files, 19 research claims verified)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-reference-analysis | 1/3 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2min)
- Trend: --

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Root cause confirmed as vial.json rows=4 vs config.h MATRIX_ROWS=8 -- fix is mechanical
- [Roadmap]: EEPROM collision hypothesis (Issue B) ruled out -- eeconfig_user does NOT collide with Vial
- [Roadmap]: Sofle rev1 Vial keymap chosen as known-working reference for split row-doubling convention
- [01-01]: All 19 research claims verified against source files -- no discrepancies
- [01-01]: Encoder KLE entries documented separately from key positions to prevent row-number confusion

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Both halves must be cleared and flashed independently (user has physical access to both boards)
- Phase 7 and 8 require physical keyboard interaction by the user (Claude cannot flash or test hardware)
