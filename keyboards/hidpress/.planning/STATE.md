# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Keycodes set in Vial must persist correctly across power cycles and map to the correct layers
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Reference Analysis

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Reference Analysis)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-13 -- Roadmap created with 8 phases covering 15 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Root cause confirmed as vial.json rows=4 vs config.h MATRIX_ROWS=8 -- fix is mechanical
- [Roadmap]: EEPROM collision hypothesis (Issue B) ruled out -- eeconfig_user does NOT collide with Vial
- [Roadmap]: Sofle rev1 Vial keymap chosen as known-working reference for split row-doubling convention

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Both halves must be cleared and flashed independently (user has physical access to both boards)
- Phase 7 and 8 require physical keyboard interaction by the user (Claude cannot flash or test hardware)
